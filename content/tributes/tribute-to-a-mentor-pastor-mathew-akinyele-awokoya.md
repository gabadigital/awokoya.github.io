It was a humble privilege to write this piece in memory of our dear classmate, brother, confidant and mentor, with whom we had shared different facetision, À life spanning fifty-five years.

In the grammar school, we were the tenth set, and were rechristened in the course of the year with gender balancing and phenotypic ally, from white-white to navy-blue white. Only in our set, **a class captain in 1966 translocated to the Senior Prefect status**, the first time in the history of the school. **The occupier of this position was Mathew Akinyele Awokoya.**

On extracurricular activities, the school had an unviable legacy of being a" thermogene" school, especially in the Western region, so boys drifted to football while a few of the other boys to literary and debating society, traditional dancing group, photography group, singing/music group, badminton group, etc(you had to belong to minimum two groups). Mathew belonged to two: music and badminton groups, this gave him Lee way for tract distribution and an opportunity to learn piano playing under Mr SA.Sagunna (of blessed memory). With the acquisition of additional five new piano, skill acquisition became a vogue, with the hope that students would play during the  routine morning devotional worship. Under this environment, a dynamic episcopal organizer emerged under CAN to organize a monthly service for all boarding schools with standard registered boarding schools in Ife division for a joined service for boarders. It was spiritually inspiring. The senior boys and girls joined the choir of st Paul's church Ayegbaju. Ife.

It was a memorable time in which some day students came to the boarding house in order to participate in the joint service a day prior to the last Saturday of the month.

The valedictory service toil place in December and we went into the world with its attendant principalities. By April 1971, meritocracy was reigning, **Mathew secured an appointment with the department of pharmacy with accommodation attached courtesy of the HOD** based into the world with all the attending principalities. By **1971, Mathew was employed by the University of I'fe** and posted to the department of pharmacy with accommodation attached courtesy of HOD of the university. We came to Ibadan for interview and meritocracy was in Vogue, l had to stay with him for the period of the session, ultimately, I was successful and got admitted into IAR&T, moor plantation Ibadan. We were four staying with Mathew and we came from different cities, for different vocational technical/professional institutions. viz: schools of nursing, of radiography, co-op college, medical laboratory technology, etc. lnfact we renamed the BQ'  '.Africa Hall'., where we made a duty roaster for all occupants irrespective of social status,. **He fed us all within his capability. He had a nondiscriminatory large heart. With the advent of digital communications, we reconnected and consistently his theme for discussion always centered on evangelism for Christ.** **Even on his sick bed, his tone never waved.** We are all candle in the hand of God, he had shone the world effective and efficient utilization of the beam. May his demise be a blessing to all. RIP.
