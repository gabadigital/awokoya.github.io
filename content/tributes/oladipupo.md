Brother Akin,
Ah ! Brother Akin ! So, I can't see you again ? Is it really true that you are no more with us ? Oh God !  O God !
My immediate Senior Brother has gone !
We are mourning Your Sudden and Unbelievable
Departure from the Earth
Who will console us ?
Who will help to wipe off
our  tears ?  Only God, 
Only God is able
My Brother
Pastor Matthew Akinyele Awokoya
We have never heard that
You were on any Annual Leave
No Vacation of any type
You faithfully and dedicatedly worked for 
The Lord - No Leave, No Rest, 
Everyday You were on the Lord's work
Evangelizing, Preaching, Teaching  and  Counselling with the words of God
Winning Souls for Christ
Is always your joy in the
Service of the Lord
We know and see you as
A truly born again man of God
A real, genuine Pastor of God
You were a Missionary
Church Planter, National Overseer
The work of God has taken
You to so many Countries
Of the World.
We thank God for Your life.
A caring, loving and highly
Accommodating a man
As you do to so many People
You are a Daddy to many children
LIn the Lord who you monitored
To success Spiritually and
Physically - You tried your best.
You are always loved in the Family
Immediate and  Extended
As you introduced Christ to the
Lives of many who are now
Soldiers For Christ
Lot's to say about your 
Successful Earthly Journey
The Little I have said
Make a memorable memories
Of You my dear Brother Akin.
May Your Soul Rest In Perfect Peace
Good Bye. Till We Meet In Heaven
