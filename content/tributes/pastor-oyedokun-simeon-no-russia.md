**His consecration and commitment to the proclamation of the gospel regardless of the soil was unquestionable**. He fought, conquered and **without doubt won the crown of righteousness.** 


May we all finish strong in Jesus name. I also pray that God will give the fortitude to his immediate family and the body of Christ to bear the vacuum his demise created. **Goodnight to a general Pastor Awokoya**
