The news of your glorious exit from the world to be with the Lord came to me with a shock that has lingered to date. It came to me while waiting for your return to South Sudan to continue the work. You left a great vacuum in South Sudan that is hard to fill, but trusting God to help us carry on. Your track record of tilling hard grounds in very hard to reach parts of the world has left a great mark in South Sudan, where Deeper Life Bible Church has finally found a footing by the grace of God. This can only happen through resilient labourers of your calibre. Just to recall one challenging series of experiences  you led us through, which is the experience of frequent ejection by landlords that has made us to shift our headquarter church four times over the years since the churchâ€™s inception in the country, coupled with the stress of locating new rented lands for our place of worship. You sailed through all of these as a gallant soldier of the cross.

Pastor Matthew Awokoya the missionary who preached, taught, trained and discipled those under him on rudiments of sound doctrines of the Bible.

This new country was devastated by wars with no amenities like electricity and functional pipe borne water. Pastor Awokoya made provision of solar panels to provide electrify in the church. He lived in mud houses because good accommodation were too expensive and many other odds. Yet none of these challenges deterred him from doing what he was in South Sudan to do for the Lord.

He was able to get a plot of land despite the fact that plot of land in South Sudan was very expensive and can go for 25-30 thousand US dollars. He was able to get eight plots of land, one of which he was able to build and completed as the first church auditorium on a Church land before his home calling.  The other were six plots of land fenced  round and the third location has a rooftop in place and the pastorium is to be built there .
He started radio preaching and goes to the air every Sunday after church service. Through that medium souls have been won with some in the church with us today.

During the two terrible wars in South Sudan, that was in 2013 and 2016 many were killed and others that survived are still in Uganda as refugees but Pastor Awokoya and his wife never left the mission post.  What a love and commitment to the Lord and flocks.

He had no comfortable car but rather drove an old right hand drive Hiace  bus offered to him by someone who observed him walking and using motorbike or jumping on public transport to get to any where he had to go.
He used the bus to bring street boys to programs and to take brethren at will to places near their homes.  He was totally given to the work of the Lord.

No complaints nor did he ever murmur in any situation which he found himself.
He joyfully served and laboured, though fatigued yet he persisted and pushed till he laid down his tools at the feet of Jesus peacefully. We have no doubt you indeed had a special calling for such mission fields. We miss your fatherly counsels and leadership, but God knows why you have to depart at a time like this. Our greatest consolation is that by God's grace we will meet at the feet of Jesus in heaven for an eternal fellowship with our maker in Jesus name. Amen.
