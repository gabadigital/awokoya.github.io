To God be the glory, that you have departed this earthly pilgrimage for your mansion and rewards from the Lord.
Dear  Desert Warrior, as I fondly called you, you finished your course, kept the faith, fought a good flight, and now wear your Crown.

I first met with this great Mentor and God's general in Jos at a December retreat and drank from his message titled " this is the fruit of the land", it was at that retreat that the Lord gave me the purpose of my life, to which has led me this far. From there I began to visit his church and ministry at Maiduguri, for mentorship and spiritual development.

I was challenged with devotion, selfless pursuit of the gospel mandate, holiness, disciplining of converts.
His open-hearted love for believers, has no equal.
Farewell, great general of God, may God raise up from his family, another gift to the Body of Christ.
Our mother, may God bless and strengthen you in times like this to run the race to join the overcomers throng, like our Pastor, and to the children ,may God of comfort, comfort you all, and help you to cherish the divine and redemption legacies our Pastor left behind, and keep it, while following in his foot steps.
