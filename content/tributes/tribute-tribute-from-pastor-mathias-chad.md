Mom, Deborah, Princess, Moses and Daniel.

Good evening,
With the departure of our dear dad to glory and in these cruel times, I beg you to accept my most emotional and sad condolences.

To the instrument that God used powerfully for my spiritual transformation. What I have become today on the Evangelical level, I owe it in part to this man who deserves testimony and tributes.

A great man has gone home. He landed in Chad in 1987 with the only passion to win souls to God, he established churches in Ndjamena and deep Chad. He poured into the word of God, he was able to gather around him by the power and wisdom of God of reversed alcoholics and hopelessness.


He bequeathed to the Chadian church an unparalleled spiritual legacy: microphone preaching, new style evangelization campaigns, prayer vigils...His mission in Chad has been fulfilled. **He was the pioneer of Chad's Deep Life Bible Church.**


He taught me how to love God and serve Him by his way of living. He was an unparalleled visionary, a spiritual bulldozer and a dynamic and prophetic intercessor. He had the words and illustrations for every situation in life.
