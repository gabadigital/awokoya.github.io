Interesting, **my own dad met Pastor in 1979** and sought counsel from him while my daddy was a student at the University of Maiduguri.


Little did I know that **I also was to seek guardianship from Pastor again in 2009** while I also was a student at the University of Maiduguri. **30 years! And two generations of kindness shown towards me. That's how massive and warm Pastor was.**


I remember being in Pastor's sitting room and we started talking. I reminded him of my father and he was so pleased. My father even spoke with him again. We had never met before, I only was friends with his boys.
At 2009, I was at a spiritual crossroad, and I remember Pastor driving me back to school campus in his jeep. We started sharing again. I tried being evasive, but with Pastor, it was different. Pastor was so warm and gentle that he melted all my defenses. Pastor was different. I could trust Pastor with my vulnerability. His last words to me that day was simple: ***"Listen to me my son, I have told you what to do so that it can be well with you, so that things work well for you"***.


Pastor later told my sister about me that day, and she started teasing me again, and here I was acting so grown up. ðŸ˜‚
Pastor was just a warm FATHER.
In 2015, shortly before my father passed on to glory, he spoke with my father again and prayed with him. I was told and I felt at peace.
Pastor loved my family. His family have been very close to my family : The Dr Onyebuchi's.


The news of Pastor's exit to glory was not surprising to me. God had always known. God comforted us. But I keep telling God that I have lost all the big stuffs (Daddies) in my life, and yes it still hurts.


**Pastor's final words to me has being my guiding light.** I pray every day hoping that I should never stray from the narrow path.
Pastor, I hope to see you again at the Beautiful Gate, and we shall dance at the banks of the River of Life. Goodnight Papa.
