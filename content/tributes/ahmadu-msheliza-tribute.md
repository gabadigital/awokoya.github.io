The name Brother Awokoya (as he was fondly called then) was synonymous with “love no the world neither the things that are in the world”. He was a paragon of the grace of God and was consecration incarnate. Wise people that sought to enter the Kingdom of God love him very much but worldliness hated him perfectly.
He was not a spiritual illiterate so brother Awokoya did not classify somethings to be spiritual and somethings to be secular. To him everything “is Spiritual”. To this end, he left an unsurpassed record at the Department of Physics, University of Maiduguri as an Excellent Staff.


Oh happy day, the day **I met Pastor Awokoya and attended the Bible study held at his house, University of Maiduguri Staff Quarters.** This specie of bible study was unlike the one we were having at the FCS, university of Maiduguri. One hour thirty minutes’ bible study and my life was totally turned around.


I could remember the regular participants of the bible study; **Irmiya Yakubu**, **Joel Kyari Madu**, **Daniel Ndong**, **John Yamtu**, **Dennis Ibrahim Goreng**, **John Khobe**, **Frama Abraham**, **Deborah Okuma**, and **Ebiyomei Nicky Tobi**. These young people were mostly from the six states of the North eastern Region of Nigeria. We gave up the chicken served at the university cafeteria to attend the soul-stirring teaching of the man of God.


This God’s General used the stone of the word of God to grind us into powder for use in the Master’s Vineyard. We saw grace in him. Our spiritual metamorphosis is traceable to his instrumentality. He was not just a preacher, because of this, students and help seekers milled around him. I was a beneficiary. Idrissa Bulama, Joel K. Madu, Gabriel, Amu and many others stayed at his house in Mairi village Maiduguri. He fed us, gave us money, prayed for us and counselled us.

\
Sometimes we were mindless and ate all the cooked food to the point that when Bro Awokoya came home from his preaching engagement would soak gari as an alternative. No food left for him to eat.
One day in those days (1980) somebody from Benue state came to the house at Mairi Village where we were living with him. The visitor, a young man who heard of Bro. Awokoya’s Spiritual power and humane benevolence came for help. TB had finished the young man.


He was a walking corpse. He coughed blood. In his characteristic way, pastor Awokoya received him. Infact Bro. Awokoya and this half-dead young man slept in the same room and the same bed all the days the young man was with us.


One day the spirit ministered to Pastor Awokoya that the young man’s Pilgrimage on earth was over. Come and hear pastor Awokoya’s exposition using an instructional material called the heart of man and applying literary devices called metaphor, simile, personification and adjectives he laid bare before us the fact that there is life after death and the conditions for making heaven. “The heart of man is desperately wicked, he emphasized. This three hour monumental sermon, came to us with unparallel conviction and all of us rededicated our lives to God, including the young man who prayed and God saved.


In the morning, still sitting in a chair as when he was still alive we shook him calling his name repeatedly, Adagaye Adagaye, alas he has dead. We wept. Pastor Awokoya himself thought that God had forsaken him. How could God allow this young man to die, he wept. But when he carried the young man’s remains to his hometown at Benue State something extraordinary happened. The people of Adagaye’s hometown cried their heart out, threw dust into the air and rolled on the ground. Pastor Awokoya had never seen such a thing before. He thought the villagers would kill him.


At the climax of the mourning one mad man was bought to Pastor Awokoya for prayer. This man went to the market that morning and got mad, there. He run home naked and the people requested Pastor Awokoya to cast out the devils. Pastor Awokoya in response prayed an anguish-laden prayer of faith and consequently the violent-naked newly possessed man was instantly delivered. The unearthly mourning for Adagaye turned into dancing.\
This paragon of grace touched my life in no small measure. God used him to bring my mother to the saving knowledge of Christ this event took place in 1979. Pastor Awokoya’s interpreter was the Ladan (Islamic Prayer Caller) of Government Secondary School Maiduguri. He was one of Pastor Awokoya’s Muslim converts. This shows that God used him to bring many of our people to the saving knowledge of the truth.


**My mother turned from Islam to Jesus through the instrumentality of this man of God whoever thought that my mother being a devoted Muslim could get converted.**


Some of us, the first fruit of his labour in the North Eastern part of Nigeria are here to mourn and celebrate the passage of our Pastor, Evangelist, Teacher, and father in the Lord who electrified our cities with the light of the gospel.
