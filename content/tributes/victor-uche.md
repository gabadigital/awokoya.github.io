A great father of faith. Remember him preach on the Power of the Holy ghost in a campus retreat in Kaduna, that message lasted for over 2hours and many forgot to take lunch during the break time. People kept praying. 


A fire brand that inspired lots of indigenous **Borno pastors**. **PST Pogu, PST Yerima, and even PST Solomon and PST Okocha from the SE**. A father with exemplary courage to go anywhere for the gospel.
