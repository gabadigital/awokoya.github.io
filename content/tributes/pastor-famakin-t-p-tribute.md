'Pastor Matthew was fondly called 'the desert warrior' in the Arab region because of his dogged tenacity and fervent passion for the salvation of the sons and daughters of Abraham of the Arab stock. His memory will remain evergreen in the hearts of the Arab brethren and ministers whose infectious but unpretentious candor charmed to believe in the missionary revelation couched in the prophetic vision of Isaiah that  'In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to  Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians...'

Pastor Matthew's missionary contributions had started burgeoning into fruition. The Lord had been faithful in giving the Deeper Christian Life Ministry open doors beyond Egypt into Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait.

Death is a mere punctuation in the full sentence of the life of the 'desert warrior.' Eternity will unfold the full revelation of the unwritten chapters of the missionary adventures of this man of God in the Arab world.
Beloved brother, your infectious smiles will remain in our memories. And the flame you lit in our hearts will never want in radiance till the day dawns in Jesus's name. We love you. But the LORD you served with your whole life loves you more!
