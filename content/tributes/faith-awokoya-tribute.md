Having a Father in-law like mine was one of God’s greatest blessing to me this past year. One time papa and I were speaking over the phone(he was in Sudan at the time), I remember him particularly interested in knowing all the names of my siblings and mother. Right from the beginning he took me as one of his own, even before I married my husband. I fondly remember his warmth and smile the first time I paid him and mummy a visit. Being the father that he was, he sat me down and told me about his university days, about lecturing and when he decided to walk closely with God. He ensured that the message of the gospel was included in almost all the conversations we had. **I felt so welcomed, and left that day thinking about how heaven conscious someone can be, not just for himself but also for as many that came in contact with him.** 

I also remember that we had opened the Bible together to get God’s perspective about an issue on one or two occasions. After my wedding, Daddy still called me at different times to check on me. I never doubted his love for me and I always wondered if there were father in-laws that show so much care and concern to their daughter inlaws. Daddy was the type of Christian who not only believed the word but obeyed and acted it out. He was a true soldier for Christ, taking the message of the gospel to the ends of the Earth. He actively lived out John 9:4, Acts 1:8. **He was indeed a father and a good soul.**
