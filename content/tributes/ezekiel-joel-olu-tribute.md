So it's true! He left without our having our usual jovial, but thought-provoking, banters? During our last discussion, he was full of life, and in South Sudan! 


**Our renowned "Desert Warrior", is gone! Adieu!** The DCLM has lost a daring, tireless, indefatigable, uncommon, humble, amiable, friendly but firm, unpretentious, and fiery Army General. **His commitment to the Gospel, and submission to leadership remain second to none!** My thoughts are with the precious family he has left behind. He has gone to his rest, I believe. May God console his family and the DLBC in Sudan, and especially in the Chadian nation.
