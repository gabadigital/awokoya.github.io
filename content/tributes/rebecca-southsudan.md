Daddy Awokoya Matthew, it's sad losing you in this time,  **we were expecting you in South Sudan for retreat 2020**,  However you are no more, you are departed to heaven. I believe that you are sitting up at the right hand of God with Jesus Christ.


Words of mouth and written words can't express how much **your labor and missionary work in South Sudan changed my life and many in my country.** I thank God almighty for the seed of righteousness and holiness you planted and invested in the life of many South Sudanese,  I also thank God for sister Mary Awokoya who introduced me to Deeper life church in Thongpiny Juba in 2013. I remember that day, I was crying because I was heavenly loaded up with much bondage in my heart but you preached and prayed for me, my  marriage and careers changed because **you said I should call God for anything**. I remember how I asked for your prayers  each time I go for interviews and I get  all the jobs you prayed for,  I have learned a lot about the kingdom of heaven that I never knew before coming to Deeper life,  And today I am proudly a child of God because you made me understand everything about Jesus Christ.


**With all my heart and spirit I would like to thank God for the gift of Awokoya Matthew**. I came to understand that God is a giver of strength and courage, daddy worked with no fear of death, even in sickness he would still stand strong and preached the word of God. I remember in 2016, the day war broke out, he was praying loudly and we had lots of gun shoots near the national security office.  Daddy would run around driving to radio station preaching to the people, house fellowship and church building. The strength he had no any young man has it in South Sudan, this kept me speaking in heart that when you know God like daddy people don't grow old, age and bad situation of South Sudan did not limit pastor Awokoya. 


I have **known you as an uncompromising solider, mentor and a counselor and above all your unconditional love for the work of God.** Daddy was a father of faith I remember in 2014 when I was in court with my drive who sold out my car and on Sunday something told me to tell you about it, but you said first thing tomorrow morning on Monday go to court and withdraw that case, so I did as he said, surprisingly on Thursday at 8pm my cousin called me from Wau telling me that they have seen my car, surely that car was got by faith.


**I pray that I will not depart from good news of Christ that you install in my life and many others in South Sudan. I thank God for Mama Mary Awokoya Matthew and the son Joseph and brother David Ameh for their unwavering support to daddy in the work of the ministry in our country.**
Mummy I remember that day after the fighting the water of first rein fall how they were black in color and daddy Awokoya was busy working inside the church while we're talking about the war days. I know God has already rewards him with everlasting life in heaven.
It's most difficult time for me writing this to say goodbye to my commander in chief of army of God.
Much love to the family and friends and church of Deeper life Nigeria.
**May The soul of daddy rest in peace.**\

Your daughter in Christ Jesus.
