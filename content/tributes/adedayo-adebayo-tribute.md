I remembered in one of our Congress heart to heart talk as a father to a son. How you told me that you tried to start Deeper Life in 1970s when you came to Glasgow for a course. And when I told you that the little seed you planted has grown to become a region now in DCLM UK. 


How you were so happy that the Lord has answered your prayers. God bless you sir. Continue to rest in His bosom. And we shall continue to keep the faith and win more souls into the Kingdom. Already missing your calls daddy. Farewell!
