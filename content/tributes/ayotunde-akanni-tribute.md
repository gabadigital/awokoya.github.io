Adieu my Uncle,
I never imagined it could be this soon, that morning, when mummy called me, praying and crying, I couldn't even ask for what happened until I was inside  Lagos bus, I thought you were just in comma, I didn't know it was the end.

I will forever cherish **the love you have for your sister my - mum which was extended to me.**
The relationship you shared with her is one value I will always keep, I couldn't doubt it the day you said that:
**"You told the Lord that if it's only one child you would have, God should give it to your sister so that she would not loose her soul while looking for a child".**

**Thank you for those Morning Devotional Messages** you always sent.  You did that for many years and I never bordered to read for a day just because I thought you wanted me to attend Deeper Life Church, until last year January, 2020 that I started reading them.
**Those Daily Messages have really helped my spiritual growth,** Thank you for not giving up on me.\
I will hold on to the path you have shown me and to the memories of the last day we shared.

Glory be to God! You laid down your sword victoriously.  You have joined the Host of Heavens to sing - Hallelujah.
Adieu My Dear Uncle
